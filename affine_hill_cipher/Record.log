We know the plaintext is:	 ADISPLAYEDEQUATION 
it's ciphertext is:		 DSRMSIOPLXLJBZULLM
The size of Key matrix and vector 'b' is: 3
Change the letters in ciphertext into number(0-26):
 [3, 18, 17, 12, 18, 8, 14, 15, 11, 23, 11, 9, 1, 25, 20, 11, 11, 12]
Change the letters in plaintext into number(0-26):
 [0, 3, 8, 18, 15, 11, 0, 24, 4, 3, 4, 16, 20, 0, 19, 8, 14, 13] 

Can get 6 equations:
[3, 18, 17] 	=  [0, 3, 8] 	* E_k + b
[12, 18, 8] 	=  [18, 15, 11] 	* E_k + b
[14, 15, 11] 	=  [0, 24, 4] 	* E_k + b
[23, 11, 9] 	=  [3, 4, 16] 	* E_k + b
[1, 25, 20] 	=  [20, 0, 19] 	* E_k + b
[11, 11, 12] 	=  [8, 14, 13] 	* E_k + b

Choose 3 equations as a group, can build 2 linear equations(matrix):
[[3, 18, 17], [12, 18, 8], [14, 15, 11]] 	=  [[0, 3, 8], [18, 15, 11], [0, 24, 4]] 	* E_k + b
[[23, 11, 9], [1, 25, 20], [11, 11, 12]] 	=  [[3, 4, 16], [20, 0, 19], [8, 14, 13]] 	* E_k + b

Use the 'line2 - line1', we can get this equation(mod 26):
[[20, -7, -8], [-11, 7, 12], [-3, -4, 1]]  =  [[3, 1, 8], [2, -15, 8], [8, -10, 9]]  * E_k

We can get the inveerse of right matrix(mod 26):
 [[15.  3. 10.]
 [ 4.  3. 14.]
 [20. 18.  1.]]

Then we get the matrix of key:
 [[ 3.  6.  4.]
 [ 5. 15. 18.]
 [17.  8.  5.]]

Then, solve one of the equations above the 6 lines, the vector 'b' is:
 [[ 8. 13.  1.]]
